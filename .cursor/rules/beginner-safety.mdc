# Beginner Safety Rules

## Before Making Changes
- Always explain what you're about to do and why
- If a change might break something, say so
- Offer to create backups of files before major edits

## Error Handling
- When errors occur, explain them in simple terms
- Provide the exact fix, not just hints
- If you're unsure, say so rather than guessing

## Avoid Overwhelming
- Don't introduce advanced patterns (state management, APIs, databases) unless specifically needed
- One feature at a time
- Celebrate small wins - acknowledge when something works!

## Dependencies
- Minimize external packages
- This is a simple static site - no build tools needed
- Keep it simple: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
